Students who have disabilities who wish to receive academic services and/or accommodations should visit the [Disability Access Services](https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu) at 20 Dodge Hall or call (617) 373-2675.

Please be sure to provide your instructor with DAS’s accommodations letter early in the semester in order to avoid logistical challenges. This course includes a significant group work including project, and providing extensions for group work can be complex. DAS accomodations often do not apply to group submissions but we encourage you to work with your instructors to see how course staff can provide the support you might need. It is the **student’s** responsibility to coordinate with the instructor in order to request suitable accommodations.
