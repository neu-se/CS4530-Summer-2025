Students must work individually on all individual assignments, and only with their assigned group on other assignments. We encourage you to have high-level discussions with other students in the class about the assignments, but the work you turn in must be only your own. Copying any part of another student’s assignment is strictly prohibited.

If you steal someone else’s work, you fail the class. You are responsible for protecting your work. If someone uses your work, with or without your permission, you fail the class.

You are free to reuse small snippets of example code found on the Internet (e.g., via StackOverflow) provided that it is properly attributed. Submitting {blindly} copy-pasted code from any online resources is never ok. **Developing code with co-pilot or other generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT is not allowed on individual projects or on the team project.** The sole exception is Individual Project #3.

You are expected to make a good-faith attempt to avoid reliance on "AI Overview" features in search engines, and to verify anything you see there with authoritative sources. 

**To ensure that students have completed the work themselves (and have gained necessary understanding), instructors might require students to explain the work they have submitted. We will consider adjusting grades based on your understanding of the course material.**

If you are concerned that by reusing and attributing that copied code it may appear that you didn’t complete the assignment yourself, then please raise a discussion with the instructor. If you are in doubt whether using others’ work is allowed, you should assume that it is NOT allowed unless the instructors confirm otherwise.
