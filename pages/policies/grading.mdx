Your grade in this course comes from:
 - 30% Individual projects (6% for the first project, 12% for the second and third project)
 - 40% Team project (including peer evaluation and surveys)
 - 15% Class participation and practice activities
 - 15% Midterm exam

In addition, passing the course requires:

 - a 50% score on at least two of the three individual projects
 - a minimal score on the midterm (this threshold won't be higher than 50%, and may be lower)
 - demonstration of success at software engineering (working with a group to create software features) and software development (actually writing code) through the final project
 - participating in group presentations on the last two days of class (excused absences will need to do a make-up presentation)

These four requirements are not intedned to be gotchas â€” they're intended to communicate that these are not optional parts of the course.

Because this is an in-person course, you are expected to be available to work on the team project in person to pass the class.

## Late homework

Individual projects and practice activites can be turned in within 24 hours after the due date for a 10% penalty.

## Assignment of team project grades

In cases where team members do not equally contribute to the project, we may assign different grades to different individuals. This deduction will not be greater than 50% unless the student doesn't contribute enough to demonstrate success at software engineering and software development (which would make them unable to pass the course).

We will evaluate each individual's contribution on the basis of a variety of factors, including progress reports at weekly meetings, through inspecting version control history, through each students' self-reflection, and through each students' peer evaluations during and after at the end of the project. We will make regular efforts to collect and distribute this feedback throughout the project.

## Grading grievances

If you have concerns regarding the grading of your work, please let us know within 2 class days. (Class days are Monday through Thursday: if you get work back on Monday the two days are Tuesday and Wednesday you must request a regrade by midnight Wednesday. If you get work back on a Wednesday the two days are Thursday and Monday and you must request a regrade by midnight Monday.)

If your regrade request is closed and you feel that the response was not satisfactory, you may appeal to the instructor via email within 24 hours.
