title: Installing NVM when using the fish terminal (Linux / Mac)
---

[Go back to the getting started tutorial](tutorials/getting-started)

Note: When using the Fish terminal, [`nvm.fish`](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish) should be used to install nvm. This is not a fish wrapper for nvm. rather it is written from scratch using fish. Current version of NVM is not supported on terminals that are running fish or have installed fish in the past.

1. Install nvm.fish using Fisher: `fisher install jorgebucaran/nvm.fish`
2. Restart fish by entering `fish` in your active terminal
3. Verify nvm is working by entering `nvm -v`
4. Install the required version of Node.js by typing `nvm install 23`.

_Working with MacOS M1 Silicon_: If you have macOS on M1 Silicon 2022, you can find instructions [here](https://benscheer.medium.com/how-to-install-nvm-and-node-on-macos-m1-silicon-in-2022-172fba82d92f).
