Learning Objectives for this activity:

- Practice applying asynchronous programming concepts: promises, async/await
- Experiment with applying different ordering constraints in asynchronous code

## Overview

In this activity, you will experiment with asynchronous programming constructs in TypeScript.

### Getting started

Download the [starter code](code/async-activity.zip) and run `npm install`. Then run `node src/example.ts` to run some examples.

### Stringing together async calls

Your task is to complete the three `async` functions in `src/todo.ts`, `importGrades1`, `importGrades2`, and `importGrades3`. Each of these functions takes an input of the type `ImportTranscript[]`, creates a student record for each `ImportTranscript`, posts grades for each students, and then fetches and returns the stored transcripts for each student.

You can test your implementations by running `node src/runner.ts`.

The three implementations should each handle concurrency differently:

1. Insert a student, insert each of their grades (sequentially in order), then insert the next student, then their grades, etc. until all students are inserted, then fetch transcripts.
2. Insert a student, then insert each of their grades, then fetch their transcript (sequentially in order). Do this set of sequential operations concurrently for all students.
3. Insert a student, then insert all of their grades concurrently, and do that concurrently for all students. After all students have all of their grades submitted, fetch all of the transcripts concurrently.

Submit the file `src/todo.ts` on Gradescope.
