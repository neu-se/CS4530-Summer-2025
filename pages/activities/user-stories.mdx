This activity will give you practice with using user stories to solicit and document user requirements, refining them into conditions of satisfaction, and assigning priorities.

Before you start, be sure to review the tutorial "User Stories and Conditions of Satisfaction" on the course website.

## Scenario

Consider a Learning Management System (like Canvas).  Choose ***one*** of the following areas:

1. Sections and Enrollment
2. Assignment Submission and Grading
3. Gradebooks

Feel free to propose a different area to an instructor or TA.

## Requirements for this activity

1. Say which area you picked.

2. Identify at least 3 different roles representing different classes of users for the area you picked.
   
3. Choose **one** of those roles and write down at least 3 different user stories for that participant.  These should be of the form
   
    As a <code>&lt;role&gt;</code> I want <code>&lt;some capability&gt;</code> so that I can <code>&lt;get some benefit&gt;</code>

4. For **each** user story, write 3 conditions of satisfaction with appropriate priorities. 

Please submit a total of:

* 1 area
* 3 roles
* 3 user stories
* 9 conditions of satisfaction with priorities

When you are done, submit your work as required by your instructor (check the Canvas assignment for details, if assigned). This may vary from section to section.
