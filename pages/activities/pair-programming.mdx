In this activity, you will participate with one other student in a relatively formal version of pair programming. Your starter code will be an Express website with some Zod validation built in, you can download it (here)[code/pair-programming.zip] and run npm install as usual.

Your starting task is to improve the tests and complete the implementation for the `/analyze` POST endpoint. The intent is that this endpoint counts the words in the input and returns a mapping of frequency counts. You will receive further instructions after you've had a chance to implement this first part.

This is only an in-class activity, there is nothing to submit on Gradescope.
