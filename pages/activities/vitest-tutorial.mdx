This activity is intended to supplement the CS4530 lecture on test-driven development.

## Steps

1. Download and unpack the [starter code](code/vitest-tutorial.zip).
2. Write down two testable behaviors for the `addGrade` function corresponding to the condition of satisfaction that "the user can add a new grade for an existing student." These should be written as `it("<testable beahvior>", () => {})` in `tests/transcript.service.spec.ts`.
3. Identify at least two exceptional conditions or design decisions associated with these testable behaviors, and document these as comments in `tests/transcript.service.spec.ts`.
4. Add Vitest tests for your testable behaviors.
5. Implement a method `addGrade` to `src/transcript.service.ts` that passes your tests.
6. Submit on Gradescope.
