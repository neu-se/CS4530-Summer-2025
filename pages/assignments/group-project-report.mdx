## Submission Instructions

Both the group report and individual reflections will be submitted on Gradescope.

### Project Report

Each team will submit a final project report, which directly accounts for 10% of the final project grade and may influence grades on other parts of the project. The report will consist of three sections:

The **Feature Overview and User Manual** should contain the URL of your deployed app, screenshots that thoroughly document your new features, and a walk-through that is not as detailed as a QA plan, but that is detailed enough to reliably guide your TA through all the new features you have added. It shouldn't have more than a page or two of text, but may have lots and lots of images.

The **Technical Overview** should describe a description of the major technical changes you've made to the system. Imagine you're all going on vacation in Antarctica starting tomorrow, and a colleague who has been on paternal leave for last four weeks (which, fun fact, is [double the US average](https://web.archive.org/web/20250425082703/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave_in_the_United_States)) will be responsible for working on the site; your job is to provide an excellent overview of how the site has changed, with rationales, diagrams, and evidence of testing as necessary.

The **Process Overview** should describe in detail the components of agile project management processes used during the project (i.e., sprints, sprint reviews, retrospectives and blameless reviews). The overview should also provide a summary of what was planned to happen in each sprint vs what actually happened, with a discussion of what was revised as a result, and a suggestion of best practices for the project that you would suggest to future teams.

Each of these three sections should be **at most two pages long**, and shorter is absolutely acceptable. Therefore, the entire document should be **at most six pages long**.


### Personal Reflection

Accompanying the final team deliverable will be an individual reflection, which every student must submit on their own. Satisfactory completion of all parts of this reflection is required to receive an “A” grade in the course, and may be used to calibrate project scores across multiple team members. The individual reflection also provides an opportunity for students to provide confidential feedback on the performance of their teammates.

The entire personal reflection should be **at most two pages long**, and shorter is absolutely acceptable. The reflection should consist of three sections:

**Project concept:** How does the project that you delivered compare to what you originally planned to deliver? What caused these deviations? Where were these deviations necessary compromises, and where were they unforeseen opportunities?

**Project process:** How did the process by which you designed and implemented evolve from your original project plan? Were there any processes that in hindsight, you wish that you followed, or wish that you followed better? Were there any that were particularly helpful?

**Project team:** Provide a frank (and ideally, blameless) postmortem of your and your teammates collaborative performance and participation. If you had to do this same project over with the same teammates, what would you have done differently (or not) to improve your team’s overall performance?
