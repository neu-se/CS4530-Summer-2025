Each group will give a rehearsed presentation including a live demo to show one of the features they have added to the site. You will have one minute for setup and **eight minutes to present**; going over time will cost you points.

Your presentation should include:

 - A title slide with your group's name and the names of your group members
 - 1 slide with the overall theme of your project and all user stories
 - 1 slide for _each_ user story listing the conditions of satisfaction, numbered in the way they were numbered in your proposal (i.e. 3.2), and their priority. Indicate whether the conditions of satisfaction were met; feel free to use percentages.
 - (Optional) Max 1 slide describing any deviations from the proposed plan (required if you deviated from the plan!)
 - (Optional) Max 1 slide describing challenges you faced as a group and how you met them.
 - 1 slide summarizing overall contributions made by each group member (1-2 sentences max per member)

You can include additional information as well, but be careful about the time limit!

As part of your presentation, you must do a live demo one or more of your features using the *live, deployed website* (**not** localhost). Make sure to rehearse this!

Attendance is required for **all demos**, not just your own. Every group will submit peer feedback on other groups' presentations. **Be on time,** we will have a tight schedule. Please email the instructor if you have extenuating circumstances.
