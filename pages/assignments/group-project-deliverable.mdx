The group as a whole will deliver:

 - The strategy.town website extended with your new features, deployed to a suitable cloud service
 - The code and tests for your website
 - A flier advertising your new features

In addition, the group as a whole will produce a project report, and each group member will submit a personal reflection; these are described [separately](assignments/group-project-report).

## Submission Instructions

### Code, Documentation, and Deployment

The README.md file must include a link to your cloud-deployed website at the very beginning. This website must remain up from the final project deadline until the grading deadline (2pm on June 26, 2025). Minor changes are allowed as long as any changes to the website are deployed from, and reflected in, the `main` branch of your project repository.

Course staff must be able to preview the website locally in as a developer, and your README.md file must also include clear instructions for how to do this.

**To submit on Canvas:** Push code, tests, testing plans, and documentation to your team's GitHub repository, create [a release on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository), and apply the tag version `final-submission`. After your release is created, you’ll find that there is now a `.zip` file that can be downloaded from GitHub that contains a snapshot of your entire repository. Download this zip file, unpack it, and follow the instructions that you provided in your README.md file to double-check that the course staff will be able to run your project (this step is handy to make sure that you didn't forget to include some key files in git). If needed, you can delete the release, make some changes, and re-release up until the deadline. Submit this zip file to Canvas under the assignment “Project: Code Submission”

### Project Flier

Each team will submit a single-sided 8.5x11 color PDF that contains the following:

 - Team name
 - Team members
 - Link to cloud-deployed website
 - Short description of the project (OK to reuse text from the project plan/report)
 - Link to public demo site, link to source repo (OK to make the repo public now, or OK to leave as private)
 - Short description of the technology stack and overall design decisions
 - Screenshots demonstrating the main functionality that you implemented
 - Short "what's next" section describing future work that could build on your project (optional)

Past semesters have had a "project poster" which you can see from the [spring 2025 showcase](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2025/assignments/project-showcase). The "flier" concept is both to encourage pithy, effective, and visual communication and so that it's possible for course staff to actually print out the artifact.

*Submit on Gradescope.*

## Grading 

More detailed rubrics for these deliverables will (hopefully) be provided here later; these will be similar to the [rubric for the spring semester](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2025/assignments/project-grading) with the exception that modifying ESLint rules that apply to _tests_ is absolutely permitted.
