### About this site

This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a customizable framework for content-heavy static and dynamic sites (with an emphasis on static site generation). (As of 2025 when I'm creating this, Astro is a stable but currently-cool toolset. If you're reading this in the future and Astro is an ancient and unmaintainable mess, I'm sorry, it was inevitable, but at least everything's mostly markdown under the hood. - Rob Simmons)

### Local development environment

If you have Node LTS 22 or above, you should be able to go to:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

and then go to the URL that pops up on the command line (probably <http://localhost:4321/CS4530-Summer-2025>).

### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the repository, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ activities/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ calendar.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tutorials.md
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ code
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ week1-unit-testing
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ jest-tutorial-starter-code.zip
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Here are a couple of the relevant facts:

- Anything in the `public/` directory is placed, unprocessed, on the website. So that zip fill will be at `$PROJECT_ROOT/code/week1-unit-testing/jest-tutorial-starter-code.zip`.
- The `src/` directory, along with the `astro.config.mjs` file, contain all the Astro configuration for the project. In most cases it should not be necessary to touch this configuration unless you're changing the site.
- Each page in the `pages/` directory corresponds to a page on the site (with the same path, minus the `.md` extension). Astro is, in general, big on [file-based routing](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#file-based-routing).
- The `.env` file contains site-wide configuration. If you're updating the website for a new semester, or adapting the repository for a new course, you'll need to update the values in this file.
- The `src/` contains all the code for building the site, but hopefully shouldn't need to be messed with too much once it's set up.

### Links

The website uses [`<base>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base), which means that all _relative_ links on the site are relative to the root of the project, <https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Summer-2025/> or whatever. In general, you should use fully relative links: if you're trying to link to the page specified as `pages/tutorials.md` from anywhere on the site, it should look like `[this](tutorials)`, and if you're trying to link to the `public/code/week1-unit-testing/jest-tutorial-starter-code.zip` file from anywhere on the site, it should look like `[this](code/week1-unit-testing/jest-tutorial-starter-code.zip)`.
